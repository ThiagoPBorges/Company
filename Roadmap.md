-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Month 01: Structuring and Showcasing (The "MVB" - Minimum Viable Business)

    Objective: Not is have clients yet, is be ready for receive one.

    1.Define my niche of attack:

        - Action: Based on Administration, focus on small and medium-sized enterprises (PMEs) who make money but don't know where it comes from or where it goes.
        - Pitch: "I organize the financial and operacional caos of enterprises using data."
    
    2. The LIVE PORTIFOLIO:

        - Action: Create a app using Streamlit.
            Tab 1: "About me" (My Photo, Summary: Admin + Tech)
            Tab 2: "My services" (Automation, Financial Dashboards, Management Apps)
            Tab 3: "Projects" (Links for the apps that I already did)
            Tab 4: "Contact" (Direct link to my Whatsapp or Linkedin)
        
Month 2: Active prospection and content creation

    Objective: To get out of inertia. Get the first 'Yes', even if it's cheap.

    1. Instagram vs LinkedIn:

        - Linkedin (80%): Where clients are (Managers, Owner of PME's)
        - Instagram (20%): Show "backstage" and visual autority

        - Action: Post 1x per week on linkedin a "Case Study".
            - Struture of post:
                Problem: The customer took 4 hours to close the register.
                Solution: I created this script in Python.
                Results: Close in 5 minutos.
                Link: Watch the video of tool working.
    
    2. Strategy of "Beta Client" (Social proof)

        -Action: Aproach some known who own businesses or hold management position.
        - Irresistible offer: Propose to build something only by testimonial and permission to use it in their portifolio.
    
    3. Freelance Plataforms (Sales training)

        - Action: On Workana/Upwork. Offer what they asked for, but specify in the proposal any extra work that can be done to improve and automate the process using another tool.

Month 3: Professionalization and process

    1. Productized Service

        Goal: Create closed packages
            Ex: Pack A: "Diagnosis of data" (Cleaning data + 1 Dashboard)
    
    2. Contract and Formalization

        Action: Create a model of contract. Pay attention to extra revisions.
